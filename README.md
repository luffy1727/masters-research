## Working during studies

###### Can i work while I do my masters in US?
Basically, **no.**
> **Students with F-1 visas can work on-campus for 20 hours a week or less**

Off-campus employment with a US student visa
Things can get a little more complicated if you wish to work off-campus, but there are some training programs that F1 students can get permission to work under.

As you would expect, off-campus employment is work that that takes place outside of the school campus. It is not impossible to obtain, but it’s only available to F1 students who have completed at least one full academic year of their program of study, and who have an economic hardship that qualifies for the Department of Homeland Security’s emergent circumstances.

You can basically apply for OPT after being enrolled for at least a year.

## Visa (US)
The first question I had was: "What kind of visa am i acquiring while I am studying for a masters degree" since it basically dictates my chances of working while I am doing my study.

#### F Visa
- F-1 visas for full-time students
- F-2 visa is for dependents of F-1 visa holders(wife etc)
- F-3 visa is for 'border commuters'

*Students with F-1 visas can work on-campus for 20 hours a week or less*
